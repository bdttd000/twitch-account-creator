# Twitch account creator with puppeteer with fingerprints

This repository contains scripts to generate twitch accounts with verification code that we can pass after we log in to this account. For now code is set to generate random nickname, password and use 10minutemail. It also uses [puppeteer-with-fingerprints](https://github.com/CheshireCaat/puppeteer-with-fingerprints) which helps us not be detected as a bot.
